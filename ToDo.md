# ToDo  

<br>

**001. Separate BinaryMouse Up's OR equalize DecimalMouse Ups**
- recognizer for active button

<br>

**002. Click & DblClick**
- recognizer/tracker for active down-button and position
- 'use' UsrESC recognizer (follow 4 click) - *position*
- 'use' UsrESC recognizer (timing 4 dblClick) - *position*
- move from ESCsequence auto-disables click/dbClick

<br>

**003. Mouse Selection**
- Up isn't Down...

<br>

**004. ByteMouseBug X/Y greater 255**
- The axis is deleted in terminal -> TUI communication
- UsrESC (but with StreamInESC-Len) -> SaveErrorReturn
- however add generic corrupt length (control by UsrESC-Timeout)

<br>

**00n. Numerate ESC Events an un-trashy way**  
- *I'm reverse-engineering for... I don't know anymore*

<br>

**00n. Check UTF (195)**  
- !! Take Care on BinaryMouseMode !!
