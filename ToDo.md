# ToDo

<br>

**011. ADD FocusIn / FocusOut**
- https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html#h3-Any-event-tracking

<br>

**010. Missing enumerations -- Key-IDs**

<br>

**009. ClearLine & ClearPartial -- FromTo**

<br>

**008. Add TerminalSizeChangeEVENT**
- Is there anything possible, better than just polling the Screen?  
Ok ! We could put the processing on the HMI-Terminal, but not on the µCs! µCs just get the Event via a regular ESC-Screensize-Command after Terminal recognized it...  
µCs must be able to do, too! Otherwise we lose the "just a Terminal-Option" (without any kind of Win/Mac/Linux binaries)
- MouseXY > ScreenXY is a nice indicator...
- FocusIn/FocusOut (see 011.) is a nice indicator...
- HAVE AN EYE on Minimize - Effects... *take care on different Terminals*   

<br>

**007. Add "Alt-Back"**
- ~~done~~ 

<br>

**006. EVENT - HANDLER**
- Mouse - almost done
- Keys - almost done

<br>

**005. Constants for ESC & Mouse Timing**
- ~~done. but with Variables~~

<br>

**001. Separate BinaryMouse Up's OR equalize DecimalMouse Ups**
- ~~recognizer for active button~~

<br>

**002. Click & DblClick**
- ~~recognizer/tracker for active down-button and position~~
- ~~'use' UsrESC recognizer (follow 4 click) - *position*~~
- ~~'use' UsrESC recognizer (timing 4 dblClick) - *position*~~
- ~~move from ESCsequence auto-disables click/dbClick~~

<br>

**003. Mouse Selection**
- ~~Up isn't Down...~~

<br>

**004. ByteMouseBug X/Y greater 255**
- ~~It starts, that the axis is deleted in terminal -> TUI communication~~  **fixed** (covered by UsrEscLenErr)  
~~then it flips to ByteValues smaller 32  "01" & "02"~~ **fixed** (covered by ByteModePositionErr)  
then after "some" of the following sequence it's a "???" what kills the app
27: ESC  
91: [  
77: M  
67: C   
2  
51: 3  
  : ByteModePositionError	[MC3

<br>

**00n. Numerate ESC Events an un-trashy way**  
- *I'm reverse-engineering for... I don't know anymore*

<br>

**00n. Check UTF (195)**  
- !! Take Care on BinaryMouseMode !!
